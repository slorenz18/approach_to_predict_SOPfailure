# A Repository for EHL and Sym. Pressure Distributions

In this repository one will find the complete series of images which illustrate all pressure distributions used in the analysis for probability of surface failure mechanism.  This repository includes the EHL pressure distributions as well as the representative sym. pressure distributions.  The EHL pressure distributions were generated using a finite difference scheme numerical model following the work of Venner et al. (1991).  The Roelands pressure-viscosity and Dowson-Higginson pressure-density relationships were used in the numerical EHL model. 

The naming convention of the images is as follows:
* For EHL: "pressure_EHL_{Hertzian Pressure}_{Hertzian half-contact width}_{Roughness Amplitdue}_{Roughness Frequency}.tif" 
* For Sym: "pressure_SYM_{Hertzian Pressure}_{Hertzian half-contact width}_{Roughness Amplitdue}_{Roughness Frequency}.tif"

Where:
* {Hertzian Pressure} which takes values of 1.00 GPa, 1.25 GPa, 1.50 GPa
* {Hertzian half-contact width} which takes values of 100 micron, 125 micron, 150 micron
* {Roughness Amplitdue} which takes values of 0.062 micron, 0.081 micron, 0.108 micron, 0.125 micron
* {Roughness Frequency} which takes values of 11, 21, 31
